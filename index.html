    <p>In this video, I will explain what full stack development is and provide a detailed overview of the technologies used to build full stack web applications. Full stack web development involves building the front-end, back-end, and database components of a web application. This means that full stack developers are responsible for everything from designing the user interface to managing the server-side logic and database.

        I will begin by discussing the key technologies and programming languages used in full stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and various front-end frameworks such as React and Angular. I will then move on to discuss the server-side technologies like Python, Java and Node Js, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Aws.
        
        Throughout the video, I will provide examples and code snippets to help illustrate how these different technologies are used in practice.
        
        By the end of this video, you will have a comprehensive understanding of what full stack web development is and the tools and technologies used by full stack developers to create powerful web applications.

    <h2>Lets Divide Full Stack into 3 Parts</h2>
    

    <ul>
        <li>Front End</li>
        <li>Back End</li>
        <li>Database</li>
